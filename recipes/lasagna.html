  <li>½ cup minced onion</li>

  <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

  <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

  <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>

  <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>

  <li>½ cup water</li>

  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>

  <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>

  <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>

  <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>

  <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>

  <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>

  <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

  <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>

  <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>

  <li>1 egg</li>

  <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>

  <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
    heat until well browned.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.<br />
    Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
    seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.<br />
    Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
    boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. <br />
    Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
    parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <br />
  <li>
    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
    baking dish. <br />
    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta
    cheese mixture. <br />Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1
    1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan
    cheese. <br />
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br />
    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray
    or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
    additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
