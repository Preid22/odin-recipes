<h3><em>For the Salad:</em></h3>
<ul>

  <li>4 ounces haricot verts or green beans</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, minced<br />
    garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper. In a slow, steady stream, pour in the<br />
    oil, and whisk continuously until the dressing is emulsified.<
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Cook the eggs: Place the eggs in a small saucepan and cover them by an
    inch<br />
    with water. Cook over high heat to bring the water to a boil, then turn
    off<br />
    the heat, cover the pan, and let the eggs sit for 10 minutes. Drain the<br />
    water, and place the eggs in ice water to cool. Once cooled, peel and<br />
    quarter the eggs.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Cook the potatoes: Place the potatoes in a small saucepan and cover with<br/>
    cold water. Add a generous amount of salt and bring to a boil. Cook until<br/>
    potatoes are tender and can easily be pierced with a knife, about 10<br/>
    minutes. Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool.
